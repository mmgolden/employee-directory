# Employee Directory

View the demo [here](https://mmgolden.github.io/employee-directory/).

This app is built for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distibuted company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a way for employees to share contact information with each other. The employee directory uses the Random User Generator API ([randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/)) to grab information for 12 random "employees". This app uses the browser's Fetch API to request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. This project was created for the purpose of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.
